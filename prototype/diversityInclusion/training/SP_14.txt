is fast becoming one of the worlds leading product development houses. We help clients from all around the globe
utilize and incorporate cutting edge technology in their designs and user experiences. With projects spanning consumer products, Big Data, IoT,
and automation in the resources sectors, there is no shortage of interesting challenges at.
Some of Our Projects
We are seeking Front End Developers to join our team and help out on some exciting projects.
One such project is the Front-End development of a bicycle electronics app and web app that has a growing user base approaching 100,000+ users,
and the ongoing roll out of features for it. This is using a combination of ReactJS and native iOS and Android for web and app development, a range of
Python and Javascript backend services, along with Amazon AWS traditional and serverless infrastructure.
Another fast growing project is the creation of a Financial and Economic Charting app being developed with a well funded client looking to hit the app
store later this year. Targeting tens of thousands of users, it utilizes ReactJS and Capacitor for cross platform app development as well as a mix of
Python and Javascript backend technologies. This system leverages some of our preexisting tech whilst developing specific modules for the client, to
get them to market faster.
Another project is the development of our Big Data web stack utilized by a number of our clients for capturing IoT data, then visualising and interpreting
that data to make business decisions with. This system crosses over between Data Science, Database optimisation, Web API development, user
management and Front-End development. The system powers a number of our client and internal projects.
On every project we run comprehensive CI testing on GitLab using Dockerized testing environments. We utilise AWS for production services and our
in-house server farm for development and staging.
