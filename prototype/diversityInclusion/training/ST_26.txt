As an inclusive, team-first company, our people are at the core of
everything we do.

We care deeply about creating a workplace where our team members
feel valued, respected and empowered. We are committed to providing
equal opportunity regardless of gender identity, ethnicity, disability,
sexual orientation or life stage and we are proud to be recognised as a
Gold Tier Employer in the Australian Workplace Equality Index for
LGBTI inclusion.
As our Group continues to evolve, innovate and support our
communities, we encourage our team members to do the same with
their own careers, by providing ongoing opportunities to grow and make
a real difference.

We work hard to create a safe and inclusive environment for all, and
most importantly, we're all about creating better experiences â€“ for our
customers and for each other.
