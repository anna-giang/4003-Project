Did I hear you say, "Who is Vocus?"
We are a challenger business in the Telco and Energy Industry. We listened to our customers and heard that they wanted more from a network, so
that's what we've given them.
We built the network thanks to our own team of highly skilled fibre engineers.
We own our network giving us easier, straightforward access.
We manage our network here in Australia out of our Melbourne offices.
We now have more than 30,000 km of fibre optic cable laid and operational throughout Australia, 5000 on-net buildings connected to our network.
