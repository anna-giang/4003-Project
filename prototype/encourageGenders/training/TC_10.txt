Our large telecommunications services client has recently won a new
contract on the NBN project and is now looking for experienced Field
Supervisors in who have strong copper experience.
We are looking for experienced Field Supervisors who have strong
experience working on large copper networks. The Field Supervisor
will oversee the construction and installation works of several field
crews working onsite, and will also be responsible for the overall
health, safety and compliance of internal crews and subcontractors.
Experience:
You must have a background in large physical copper networks and
be familiar with industry practices, conventions, language, systems
and other requirements.
You must be able to read plans and communicate requirements to
field crews and network designers (office based). You will
understand the configuration of pillars, network joints and how they
link to the exchanges.
This is a field role but the administration requirements are key so
use of standard applications and tablet based systems is also key.
Requirements:
As a minimum you must have an Open Cabling licence and
probably a Cert III in Telecommunications, as well as a white card
and driving licence.
Experience in running field crews is a must and safety for both staff
and the public is fundamental.
You will have a good understanding of the risks of working with
asbestos containing materials and will understand how to treat them
in a safe and compliant manner.
This role will offer a generous base salary, + superannuation and a
site vehicle. We are looking for the suitable candidates to start within
the next 4 weeks and there are roles available in NSW + VIC
