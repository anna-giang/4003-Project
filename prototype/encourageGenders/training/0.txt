It's important for you to feel that this is the right job for you. We want you for both a long time and a good time, so choose wisely! Here's some things
you'll need to bring to the role:
You genuinely think you can make a difference to the way our customers work, and you have a positive outlook on life.
You're not afraid of hard work. Curly challenges. Sometimes inconvenient hours.
Perhaps you attend (or run) local user groups. In any case, you're curious about how things work. You don't pretend to know everything â€“ and as a
result, you are constantly learning.
People trust you. You have the ability to be handed a problem and feel confident that you can resolve it.
You're comfortable with change.
You're going to write an amazing cover letter for this role :)
If this sounds like you, we strongly encourage you to apply!
